Introduction: There is a company that generates its own internal unique identifier for each security in
the market. This unique identifier is called "S2ID". The company stores the mapping from the S2ID to
various well known ID's (such as Sedol, Cusip, ISIN etc.) in flat files.
The file also mentions the various changes in the ID mapping occurring since the inception of the
company, i.e. the complete history since the start is present in the file. This is done by mentioning a
start and an end date for each ID. An ID is said to be "active" during this period.
It has been observed that a particular well known ID can be mapped to different S2ID during different
times.
For example, consider Sedol: 2792134. (You can refer to the input file for better understanding)
During 19961231 to 19970731, the sedol is mapped to ARGADU1.
During 19970801 to 19981130, the sedol is mapped to ARGADU2.
During 19981201 to 19981231, the sedol is mapped again to ARGADU1.
During 19990101 to 20080911, the sedol is mapped again to ARGADU2.
There is a frequent need of mapping the various well know ID's to a unique S2ID (if exists), given a
particular date. The returned S2ID should be such that the input well-known ID should be active at the
specified date.
Write a script that helps user to get a S2ID for a particular Sedol/Cusip/Isin.
Input: The program asks user to choose between: Sedol/Cusip/ISIN, then takes as input:
1. A comma separated list of appropriate ID's
2. The date for which to check (in YYYYMMDD format). This date will be common to all the input
ID's
Output: A comma separated list of unique S2ID's if exists else reports an error for each unmatched ID.
The code must take the input from stdin and produce output to stdout as specified above.
